## Dataset

This project explores a dataset with loan data of approximately 113,937 loans consisting of 81 features. The dataset being used for this project is the prosper loan Dataset, provided by the Udacity Nanodegree program.

The main features i explored in the data consisted of Borrowers' information and loan information


## Summary of Findings

For this exploratory analysis, my main interest was to analyze the borrowers information for relationship insights with the loans they took.

Exploring the distribution of single variables of interest in my dataset, the first insight information discovered was that california referenced as CA State had the highest count of borrowers. I also investigated the loan status of borrowers and discovered that most of the borrowers were current with their loans and have not defaulted in payments. Going further and obeserving Borrower's employment status,majority of the borrowers are either actively employed. Investigating further into their source of income, the visualized data showed that borrowers income mostly ranges from 25,000-74,999 and their monthly income distribution is skewed to the right with incomes usually less than 30k. Their income ratio is right skewed as well. Looking at the loan terms, most of the loans have a loan term of 36 months. I then moved to investigate possible relationships between two variables in the dataset using multivariate plots, I discovered that the borrower interest Rate is negatively correlated with the loan original amount. It also shows that at different size of the loan amount, the Rate has a large range, but the range of interest Rate decreases with increasing loan amount. Looking at the monthly income of borrowers, I discovered that the loan original amount is positively correlated with the stated monthly income. Also, Borrowers with verified income tend to have access to higher loan amount than borrowers without verified income. Borrowers with income ranging from ($)50,000-100,000+ are majorly homeowners. Borrowers who are employed and fulltime on average take out larger loans than other groups.

On further ivestigation using multiple multivariate variables from the dataset, i checked for possible effect verified income has on the relationship between loan original amount and income range,discovering that People who earn ($)100,000+ and have verified their income tend to get larger loan original to their counterparts who earn same income income but are not verified.
## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, my main focus is on the exploration the features of interest to source out the relationship between the borrowers and the loans collected. I introduced the features of interest, showed their relationship and finally how this relationship is affected by another variable. My main features of interest include: Borrowers' employment status, income range, stated monthly income and the loan original amount.
